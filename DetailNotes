# pipeline:  data points -> draw

vertex/vertices = points
vertex shader   = The things that take a point to another point in space (3D)
primitive assembly = take all the points and draw simple shapes. bunch of triangles
geometry shader  = take more points and draw more triangles...//usually just use default
rasterization stage  = draw stuff on screen/printer..ect
Clipping = ignore shape that is out side of the screen
fragment shader = like what is say tiny pixels, give all the information it need to color it (shade,shadow ect)
alpha test and blending stage. = see how color/opacity change when shape are mix together
