# shaders instead of creating your own shader you can use

very simple but I guess, you won't learn how shaders works in another language


        func setMatrices()//before draw tea pot
         {
                let effect = GLKBaseEffect()

                 effect.constantColor = GLKVector4Make(1, 1, 0, 1)
                 effect.transform.projectionMatrix = projectionMatrix
                 effect.transform.modelviewMatrix = modelViewMatrix
                 effect.prepareToDraw()
          }
